# LibGDX-BrickBreaker
A simple Brick Breaker game made with LibGDX and Box2D in java.

This game is made using a low level game development library in Java, LibGDX. It is more convenient to use than to write evrything from scratch with swing or other GUI libraries. Also LibGDX comes with Box2D support!

The game is simple but to learn a new library, its a very good project. Especially the new application, Tiled. The game currently have 6 levels but doesn't have automatic level changing system and no game over screen because I am too lazy for that :p.

To change level, change the level name on 24th line in MapHelper.java file.

Hope you like it:)
